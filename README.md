# BigDataProject

This repository aims to introduce to the PCA and EM statistical techniques, and take them into practice.

## Objectives

1. Understand and apply statistical data mining techniques.
2. Properly use statistical packages for data analysis.
3. Understand and apply statistical techniques related to the operation of large volumes of data.
4. Properly use statistical packages for this type of exploitation.
5. To propose an adequate visualization of the analyzed information to facilitate understanding.
