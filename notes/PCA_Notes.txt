/************************ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Notes ************************/

PCA => statistical procedure to describte the data (descriptive statistics)
- each element adjusted by the mean of each variable => we obtain the centered and reduced X matrix
- if the variables considered in the analysis are measured in distinc units, it is advisable to divide each value by its respective standard deviation => use the same units, thus, let us compare them


- large data-sets are increasingly comon, and often difficult to interpret
- if they get a lot of dimensions and kinds of variables, we may not see inferred information there

- we need a way to interpret them, assuring we got as much information as possible
- also in terms of resources, it's too difficult to work with super large datasets, or
represent in two/three dimensions plots some kind of relational information, which should need specific analysis

- in other words, the complexity of analyze, extract the information, and understand the data could be a challenge

- one option when there are lots of dimensions
- dimension = variables = columns
- is reduce the dimensionality in an interpretable way, such that most of the information in the data is preserved
- or at least, the information we want to preserve

- PCA Idea: simple-reduce the dimensionality of a data-set while preserving as much 'variability' (information) as possible,
minimazing information loss


Steps

1. Analyse the data and transform it to a matrix to work with
    - check if we can put in practice the PCA technique, via the correlation matrix

- we will see that some variables have correlation to others, that means we can use PCA, as there are relations
- but if there's no relation, the PCA technique makes no sense, because we can't combine variables not having relations

- let's suppose we can apply the PCA

2. Standarize the matrix
    - centrate the matrix, thus, removing the units to enable the comparison among all the variables
    - reduce the matrix, to work with lower values, that makes the work easier

- if we got different units for our variables, such as 'cm' and 'kg' we should remove those ones by centrating the matrix
- centrate matrix: divide and substract for each individual by its standard deviation
    - in this way, the values will get centered over the zero coordinates


- sometimes we will get data-sets with the same units for all the variables, in those cases, we don't need to standaraze the matrix, but would be a good practice
- if same units, you may apply the covariance-variance matrix to do the reduction directly

- But for statistical convenience you should standarize the matrix, as also it will limit the variance and you might get better results in correlation terms


3. FInally, we will calculate eigenvectors and values to know the principal components and the values of the Z matrix



- Correlation matrix: allows us to interpret the values obtained and decide if we can use the PCA technique
- high correlation is perfect


X Matrix, Y Matrix, Z Matrix

- the Y matrix is the centrated one and reduced
- centrate matrix: containing an adimensional values to work with that will help us with their interpretation
- the information will be transformed to the relations among dimensions

- to reduce the data we use the Covariance-variance method
- Covariance allows us to measure of how two variables change with respect to each other

- the Z matrix, is the result of multiplying the Y matrix with the eigenvectors, the ones founded by the correleation X matrix



- the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are propietary values and propietary vectors as said in the algebra premisses

- the matrix R => corresponds to the correlation matrix is so important
- that matrix validates the use of this technique

- if we are not getting correlations we cant reduce the dimensionality of our data-set,
as there are no relations between the variables/diensions, thus, we can't combine them

- so important to analyse the correlations first

- if we got 16 variables/dimensions we will get on our analysis 16 eigenvectors and 16 eigenvalues for those ones
- the best eigenvector, will be the one provinding the maximum information combining all the variables

- one eigenvector is based upon one principal component, which combines with all the others trying to relate to them

- as much information for eigenvector, more variability, which implies directly more projection, thus, more information
- the length in absolute value of the eigenvectors, represented in such biplots, is directly proportional to the variability, thus, importance


- this technique is a so good practice if you want to analyse data, and too simple to apply in R
- however, is focused on linear models, or try to work as a linear one
- in some cases can't be applied
- but there are other alternatives, such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, Sammon mapping, Canonical Correlation Analysis and Laplacian Eigenmaps



ScreePlot - displays the eigenvalues in a downward cureve sorted by largest to smalles (bar plot)
- we may see the amount of information by using one or more components

Individual distribution plot - display how the individuals are distributed using points among the space
- if the points are nearest it means that are similar, it means that are correlated
- but maybe if there's one individual or some super far away from the others, they should be considered as outliers with no correlation
- also is so good to predict or estimate about how many clusters, how we can group the data

Biplot - simply joins the previous plots, variance and individual, and try to represent them in a two dimensional way
